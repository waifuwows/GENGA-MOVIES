## 🎯 Project Scope

### What this is
-   A **metadata aggregator** that pulls info from MovieBox, Anilist & MegaPlay, and YTS.
-   A **playback controller** that delegates streaming to embedded players or local proxies.
-   A **technical demonstration** of FastAPI and React integration.

### What this is not
-   A content hosting platform.
-   A video distribution service.
-   A commercial product.

## ✨ Key Features

### Navigation & UI
-   **Unified Sidebar**: Vertical navigation for switching between standard, anime, manga, and news sources.
-   **Source Filtering**: Dedicated views for **Movies**, **Anime**, **Manga**, **Music**, **News**, **Live TV**, and **Radio**.
-   **In-App News Reader**: Read full anime/manga articles directly within the app using a premium glassmorphic reader.

## 🧠 Architecture & Workflows

### 1. General Movies & Series
*High-quality metadata and direct HTTP streaming.*
-   **How it works**: Combines metadata from TMDB with direct stream links from indexed file hosts.
-   **Stream Button**: Resolves the direct MP4/MKV link and plays it in the integrated player.
-   **Download Button**: Routes the request through the **Backend Download Proxy** (`/api/proxy/download`). This creates a tunnel, allowing you to download files even if the host blocks direct browser downloads (CORS/Referer protection).
-   **Local vs Cloud**:
    -   **Local Mode**: Frontend talks to your running `localhost:8080` server. Recommended for maximum speed and proxy capabilities.
    -   **Cloud Mode**: Frontend connects to a public community instance. Useful if you can't run Python locally.

### 2. Anilist & MegaPlay (Anime)
*Specialized Anime scraper.*
-   **How it works**: Scrapes episode lists and IDs from Anilist & MegaPlay.
-   **Stream Button**: Instead of a direct file, it loads a third-party **Embed Player** (iframe) inside the app. This ensures 99% availability for anime episodes without complex proxying.

### 3. Manga (Scans)
*Dedicated Manga discovery and reading.*
-   **How it works**: Aggregates manga titles and chapter lists from global databases (Consumet/Mangapill).
-   **Reader**: Integrated image-based reader with **Next/Previous Chapter** navigation and automatic page preloading.
-   **Downloads**: Facilitates direct ZIP downloads of chapters for offline reading.

### 4. Music (Streaming)
*Integrated music playback with chart and playlist support.*
-   **How it works**: Uses the GaanaPy API to search for songs, albums, and popular charts.
-   **Charts & Playlists**: Browse "Hindi Top 50" and other regional charts with full tracklist selection.
-   **Playback**: Direct high-quality streaming links provided by Gaana servers.

### 5. Live TV (Streaming)
*Global TV channels driven completely by the frontend.*
-   **How it works**: The app fetches country and channel metadata directly from the public GitHub repository of Famelack (`famelack-channels`) avoiding any backend API overhead.
-   **Playback (IPTV)**: Standard `.m3u8` links are played natively in the browser using an integrated, low-latency customized `HLS.js` configuration.
-   **Playback (YouTube)**: YouTube live streams bypass iframe restrictions by using the official **YouTube IFrame API** (`YT.Player`). This ensures maximum compatibility for channels that block standard embeds.

### 6. News (Feed)
- 📰 **News Feed:** Stay updated with the latest in anime, movies, and games via combined RSS feeds.
### 7. Live Radio
- **How it works**: Fetches live broadcasts from the Famelack radio dataset.
- **Background Player**: Specialized background audio player allows listening while browsing other sections.

## ⚙️ Configuration & URLs

### 1. External Service APIs (Backend)
If you are running the backend locally and wish to change where it pulls data from (e.g., if a provider URL changes), update these files:

| Service | Location | Variable | Current URL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Music (GaanaPy)** | `backend/music_service.py` | `self.base_url` | `https://gaanapy-a8jf.onrender.com` |
| **Manga (Consumet)** | `backend/manga_service.py` | `BASE_URL` | `https://api-consumet-org-x46x.onrender.com` |
| **News (ANN)** | `frontend/src/App.jsx` | - | `https://api-consumet-org-x46x.onrender.com` |

### 2. Cloud vs Local Routing (Frontend)
The application uses a hybrid routing model defined in `frontend/src/App.jsx`.

#### **The `CLOUD_BASE` URL**
The variable `CLOUD_BASE` (currently `http://localhost:8000`) acts as a hosted instance of the Genga backend. This is used as a reliable fallback.

#### **How to Replace the Cloud URL**
If you want to use your own hosted backend instead of the default one:
1. Open `frontend/src/App.jsx`.
2. Locate the line: `const CLOUD_BASE = 'http://localhost:8000';`.
3. Replace the string with your own server URL (make sure it doesn't end with a slash).

#### **Source-Specific Routing Logic**
In `App.jsx`, the variable `API_BASE` determines which backend the frontend talks to for a specific section:

```javascript
// App.jsx logic
const API_BASE = (activeSource === 'anilist' || activeSource === 'manga' || activeSource === 'music' || activeSource === 'news')
    ? CLOUD_BASE
    : localServerURL;
```

- **Cloud-Routed (Anime, Music, Manga, News)**: These sections are hard-coded to use `CLOUD_BASE` or the direct API endpoint (for News). This ensures that even if you don't have the Python backend running locally, these specialized scrapers continue to function.
- **Local-Routed (Home, Movies, CineCLI)**: These sections use your `localServerURL` (detected as `localhost:8080` by default). This is necessary for CineCLI (torrents) and direct movie proxies which rely on your local machine's network.

### 3. How it Works (Data Flow)
1. **User Action**: You click on a Manga, Music, or News item.
2. **Frontend Request**: Since the source is `manga`, the frontend sends the request to `http://localhost:8000/api/manga/...` (or directly to the News API).
3. **Cloud Backend**: The hosted backend receives the request.
4. **Provider Fetch**: The Cloud backend then talks to the actual provider (like Consumet or GaanaPy).
5. **Data Return**: The data travels back to your browser.

This path bypasses the need for you to host the complex scraping logic locally for these specific sources.


## 🔁 Client-side Routing (Deep Links)

The frontend is a single-page React application that uses React Router for navigation. By default the app is shipped with a hash-based router (`HashRouter`) so deep links work when hosting the built files on simple static servers or via preview services.

Key routes
- `/` — Home / Discover view
- `/details/:id?source=<source>` — Item details modal (source defaults to `home`). Example: `/#/details/dispatches-from-elsewhere?source=home`
- `/watch/:id?season=<n>&episode=<m>` — Watch page for a given item. Example: `/#/watch/some-id?episode=1`

Notes
- The watch page syncs the currently selected `season` and `episode` into the URL query string so you can copy/paste or bookmark an exact player state.
- `HashRouter` is used intentionally for compatibility with static hosting. If you prefer clean URLs (no `#`), switch to `BrowserRouter` and configure your server to return `index.html` for unknown paths (SPA fallback).

Testing deep links locally
1. Run the frontend dev server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
2. Open a deep-link in the browser (Vite dev server also serves hash routes):
```text
http://localhost:5173/#/watch/<ITEM_ID>?episode=1
```

Programmatic navigation
- The app uses `useNavigate()` from `react-router-dom` for internal navigation and replaces history entries when updating episode/season so the back button remains intuitive.
